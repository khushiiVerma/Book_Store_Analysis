# 📚 Online Bookstore Sales Analysis – SQL Project  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing an online bookstore's sales, customers, and inventory** using SQL.  
By executing structured queries, we extract key business insights that help **improve stock management, customer engagement, and revenue growth.**  

## 🔥 SQL Concepts Applied  
Throughout this project, I applied and reinforced the following **SQL concepts**:  

✅ **Database Creation & Table Management** – Setting up `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders` tables  
✅ **SELECT, DISTINCT, WHERE Clause** – Filtering books, customers, and orders based on conditions  
✅ **ORDER BY, LIMIT** – Identifying best-selling books and most valuable customers  
✅ **Aggregation Functions:** `SUM()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `AVG()` – Analyzing sales, revenue, and stock availability  
✅ **COUNT(), ROUND()** – Finding total books sold, unique customers, and revenue per order  
✅ **GROUP BY & HAVING** – Aggregating sales data to find trends in book purchases  
✅ **Joins (INNER, LEFT JOIN)** – Connecting books, orders, and customer data  
✅ **Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** – Extracting insights from complex relationships  
✅ **Window Functions (`RANK()`, `PARTITION BY`)** – Identifying top-selling books per genre  
✅ **Data Import using `COPY`** – Loading CSV data into PostgreSQL
